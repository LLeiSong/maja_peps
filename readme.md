# peps_maja

peps_maja_process.py is a piece of code to ask [PEPS](https://peps.cnes.fr) to process Sentinel-2 products with MAJA. peps_maja_download.py checks if the processing is completed and eventually downloads the products. PEPS is the French Sentinel collaborative ground segment : https://peps.cnes.fr. PEPS is mirroring all the Sentinel data provided by ESA, and is providing a simplified access.

This code was written thanks to the precious help of one my colleagues at CNES, Christophe Taillan, who implemented MAJA production within Peps.

This code relies on python (should work with python 2 and 3), and on the curl utility. I am not sure it can work on windows.


 

## Examples

### peps_maja_process

This script will ask PEPS to process a series of products based on a catalog request which can be made according to various criteria.  Then the processing is schedule. If more than 10 products are to be ordered, a confirmation is asked to the user, to avoid submitting erroneous requests to PEPS. 

- `python ./peps_maja_process.py  -l Toulouse -a peps.txt -d 2017-11-01 -f 2017-12-01 -p prod_list_toulouse.txt` 

will submit Maja processing for the Sentinel-2 L1C products acquired in November 2017 above Toulouse. When you provide a date YY-MM-DD, it is actually YY-MM-DD:00:00:00. So a request with `-d 2015-11-01 -f 2015-11-01` will yield no result, while `-d 2015-11-01 -f 2015-11-02` will yield data acquired on 2015-11-01 (provided they exist). The list of ordered L2A products is stored in prod_list_toulouse.txt


- `python ./peps_maja_process.py  --lon 1 --lat 43.5 -a peps.txt -d 2017-11-01 -f 2017-12-01 -p prod_list_toulouse.txt`

 which downloads the Sentinel-2 products above --lon 1 --lat 43.5 (~Toulouse), acquired in November 2017. The list of ordered L2A products is stored in prod_list_toulouse.txt
 
 - `python ./peps_maja_process.py 2 --lon 1 --lat 43.5 -a peps.txt -d 2017-11-01 -f 2017-12-01 -o 51 -p prod_list_toulouse.txt ` 

 which downloads the Sentinel-2 products above --lon 1 --lat 43.5 (~Toulouse), acquired in November 2017 from orbit path number 51 only.  The list of ordered L2A products is stored in prod_list_toulouse.txt

The processing at peps takes between one or two hours. For this reason, the dowload is asynchronous and handled by another software.

### peps_maja_download

 - `python peps_maja_download.py -p prod_list_toulouse.txt -a peps.txt -w /mnt/data/PEPS_MAJA'

checks the completion of the products listed in prod_list_toulouse.txt, and eventually download them to the specified directory /mnt/data/PEPS_MAJA

If a few products are not completed yet, you will have to try again later.
